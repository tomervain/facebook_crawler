# Facebook Crawler

## About this Project:
This project is a tool i'm developing to extract valuable data from Facebook pages.<br>
Since facebook is based on heavy scripting (PHP, JS, Ajax) behing the scenes, it becomes a big challenge to scrape data using only basic tools.<br>
I am writing different automated tasks in python, based on Selenium Webdriver to overcome the scraping challenges.<br>
**The Main Goal** of this project is to learn from the scripting experience for similar future tasks in different environments.

### Important Disclaimer:
This project is open-source and written for **educational purposes only!** scraping from websites may go against the site's policy and terms of service.
I am not taking ant responsibilty for anyone who wishes to use my code for any other uses besides the learning experience.
